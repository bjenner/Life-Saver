# Life-Saver
Experiment to see how OpenAI to create a familiar shape.

# Overview
This is a collaboration between Ken Evans and Bruce Jenner to see how easy it might be to use OpenAI ChatGPT to create a familiar shape, and print it on a 3D printer. 

The shape chosen was a familiar circular shape with a hole in the middle that a string could pass through to put on a necklace, with some wording on the face. Ken likes to give these away to strangers to let them know they are all friends to him and even small acts of kindness can be a life saver to a another.
